Ikomia plugin to launch inference on MnasNet classification model. Inference can be made from pre-trained model on ImageNet dataset or from custom trained model. Indeed you can use the [Ikomia MnasNetTrain plugin](https://github.com/Ikomia-dev/MnasNetTrain) to make the training. This plugin is based on [PyTorch torchvision implementation](https://github.com/pytorch/vision).
